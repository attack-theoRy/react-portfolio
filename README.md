## Description

This is a portfolio of my work as well as a resume and how to contact me. I used a professional template and heavily modified it for my own purposes. There is a portfolio component that is used multiple times on the portfolio page for each project and a react router used to serve each page. There is a footer as well with the year and my name. There is a dark / light theme switch as well built-in. 

This is the front page, you can also switch from light to dark theme
